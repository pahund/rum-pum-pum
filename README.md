![Monkey Logo](images/monkey-logo.png "Monkey Logo")

A browser-based music program for kids.

Uses [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) and [PIXI.js](http://www.pixijs.com/).

Written in ECMAScript 6, based on the [entity-component-system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) architecture pattern.

## Demo

[Early alpha version (in development)](http://pahund.github.io/rum-pum-pum/demo/index.html)

## Installation

Prerequisites:

* [NodeJS and npm](http://nodejs.org/)
* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)

Installation steps:

* `npm install`

Start the webpack dev server like so:

* `webpack-dev-server`

Open up [index.html](index.html) in your favorite browser (needs to support Web Audio API).

## Creating Optimized Distribution Version

Rum Pum Pum uses [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) to optimize and bundle its resources. To create a distribution,
use this command (after the steps listed above):

    grunt dist

## Running Tests

The unit tests of Rum Pum Pum are based on [jasmine](https://github.com/velesin/jasmine-jquery) and meant to be run
with the [Wallaby.js](http://wallabyjs.com/) test runner plugin for JetBrains IDEs 
([WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) or [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)).

Prior to running the tests, install dev dependencies using Bower:
  
    bower install
    
You can then create a Wallaby.js run configuration, pointing to the [wallaby.js](wallaby.js) configuration file.
