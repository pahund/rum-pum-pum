# Rum Pum Pum

![Monkey Logo](images/monkey-logo.png "Monkey Logo")

A browser-based music program for kids.

Uses [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) and [PIXI.js](http://www.pixijs.com/).

Written in ECMAScript 6, based on the [entity-component-system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) architecture pattern.

## Demo

[Early alpha version (in development)](http://pahund.github.io/rum-pum-pum/demo/index.html)

## Installation

Prerequisites:

* [NodeJS and npm](http://nodejs.org/)
* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)

Installation steps:

* `npm install`

This will install all the required npm packages and start a Grunt build that creates a `dist` folder with static
files (HTML, CSS, JS, etc.). Open up `dist/index.html` in your browser to play (needs to support Web Audio API).

## Development 

Rum Pum Pum uses [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) to optimize and bundle its resources. For easy developement
with live reloading, you can start a webpack dev server:

* `npm start`

Open up [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) in your favorite browser.

## Running Tests

The unit tests of Rum Pum Pum are based on [jasmine](https://github.com/velesin/jasmine-jquery) and can be run with
the [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/) test runner.

You can also do this with npm:

* `npm test`

If you use a JetBrains IDE ([WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) or [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)),
you can also use the [Wallaby.js](http://wallabyjs.com/) test runner plugin (commercial software, but well worth it if
you like test driven development).

You can create a Wallaby.js run configuration, pointing to the [wallaby.js](wallaby.js) configuration file.
